            <p>Due to recent events and countless years of oppression, the black lives matter movement has been larger than ever. There has been a huge  outburst of information on social media and countless videos of protests and police brutality, and the only way to sort it out is through scrolling, day after day. All that unorganized information can be overwhelming. Change begins with a mutual understanding and education. The goal of this site is to compile all necessary resources so people can educate themselves on the movement and take action that will bring real change; action beyond the simple Instagram story, as much as that can help. All petitions and donations will be organized here, along with automatic email and text messages that will type out an email to the specific cause of your choice for you automatically. The hope is that people use this website to take action, learn the truth, and share it with those who can benefit from its resources the most.</p>

                <p>From 2013-2019, only 1% of killings by the police have been actually charged. 99% of the time, a police officer is either fired or gets away scot-free. Of the 1% of officers who are charged, only 1 in 4 are actually convicted. Police officers should be held accountable for unnecessarily taking the lives of citizens without just cause.
